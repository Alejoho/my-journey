# My Journey

## The Beginnings

I am a former Agronomic Engineer. While working in my first job after graduation, I came across a business that ran its operations in a very archaic way. I proposed to the owners to create a software solution for them, free of charge. Initially, I thought creating an Access database would be enough, but then I discovered VBA under the hood of Microsoft Access and a whole new world opened before my eyes. During this part of my journey, I took the following courses on a YouTube channel called "Píldoras Informáticas":

* [Curso Access 2010 Avanzado](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL87EB5DB749276DAF)
* [Curso VBA Access](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3E8FA619DF71898)

I took these courses at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021.

Armed with this new knowledge, I started working on that first project. It was a struggle there was no AI to help back then, so I spent hours googleing things and asking questions on forums. But after a lot of hard work, I managed to finish the project and deliver it to my clients (clients even though I wasn’t paid, I approached it professionally).

I was thrilled. I had created a full application entirely on my own! But I wanted to go further. Living in a farm town, I noticed many other agricultural businesses in need of software solutions. My next project involved planning the growth of seedlings under greenhouses. To tackle this, I wanted to upgrade my skills and learn Windows Forms development with C++. Yes, C++.  

Why C++? Well, I had an Arduino and some familiarity with the language, so I started watching YouTube tutorials and even read a full book on OOP in C++:  

* *Curso de C++ Programación Orientada a Objetos* by Salvador Pozo

Fortunately, I realized early enough that C++ wasn’t the ideal choice for this project but not before finishing the book. Then… C# came into my life. This was the language for me. I said to myself, *“let’s get to work!”* My next course was, as well, from "Píldoras Informáticas":

One of my biggest gaps in my first project was working with SQL. I could create visual queries in Access, but I didn’t understand the language itself. So naturally, the next step was learning SQL:

It’s worth noting that all of this learning, experimenting, and building projects was done as a side pursuit. I had a full-time job as an engineer, so my time was limited, but my passion kept me going.  

## The Next Project  

On August 25th, 2023, I started my new project and challenge: **“Green House Schedule.”**  

I spent about two weeks planning how to approach it, gathering requirements from my clients, roughly designing the UI, and defining the data. The logic part took longer. I struggled with impostor syndrome and told myself: *“Let’s first design how to approach the main algorithm of the program.”*  

That was the true purpose of this project, determining **when to grow client orders while considering the business’s limited resources** (such as area, seedling trays, manual labor, and time). I thought: *If I can’t figure this out, why even continue with the project?*  

But I persevered. I came up with a feasible approach and started building.  

A few months later, I run into Git and realized I needed to properly learn Git and source control—knowledge I hadn’t yet mastered. So, I paused development and studied Git; again with Juan Díaz on his YouTube channel [Píldoras Informáticas](https://www.youtube.com/@pildorasinformaticas). It took me almost a month to get to the level I wanted, but with hard work, I achieved it.  

* **8/23/2023** – Finished the [“Curso Git & GitHub” from Píldoras Informáticas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU8oAlHdN5BlyaPFiNQcV0xDqy0eR35aU)  

Now, with Git under my “black belt”, I could properly version my progress and continue working on the project.  

This is not the end. This real story (my journey) is still under construction. Be patient, please.
