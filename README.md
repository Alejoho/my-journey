# My Journey

I am a former Agronomic Engineer. While working in my first job after graduation, I came across a business that ran its operations in a very archaic way. I proposed to the owners to create a software solution for them, free of charge. Initially, I thought creating an Access database would be enough, but then I discovered VBA under the hood of Microsoft Access and a whole new world opened before my eyes. During this part of my journey, I took the following courses on a YouTube channel called "Píldoras Informáticas":

* [Curso VBA Access](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3E8FA619DF71898)

I took these courses at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021.

Armed with this new knowledge, I started working on that first project. It was a struggle there was no AI to help back then, so I spent hours googleing things and asking questions on forums. But after a lot of hard work, I managed to finish the project and deliver it to my clients (clients even though I wasn’t paid, I approached it professionally).

I was thrilled. I had created a full application entirely on my own! But I wanted to go further. Living in a farm town, I noticed many other agricultural businesses in need of software solutions. My next project involved planning the growth of seedlings under greenhouses. To tackle this, I wanted to upgrade my skills and learn Windows Forms development with C++. Yes, C++.  

Why C++? Well, I had an Arduino and some familiarity with the language, so I started watching YouTube tutorials and even read a full book on OOP in C++:

Fortunately, I realized early enough that C++ wasn’t the ideal choice for this project but not before finishing the book. Then… C# came into my life. This was the language for me. I said to myself, *“let’s get to work!”* My next course was, as well, from "Píldoras Informáticas":

One of my biggest gaps in my first project was working with SQL. I could create visual queries in Access, but I didn’t understand the language itself. So naturally, the next step was learning SQL:

It’s worth noting that all of this learning, experimenting, and building projects was done as a side pursuit. I had a full-time job as an engineer, so my time was limited, but my passion kept me going.  

## The Next Project  

This leads us to the next project I mentioned earlier…
