# My Journey

## The Beginnings

I am a former Agronomic Engineer. While working in my first job after graduation, I came across a business that ran its economy in a very archaic way. I proposed to the owners to create a software solution for them, free of charge. Initially, I thought creating an Access database would be enough, but then I discovered VBA under the hood of Microsoft Access and a whole new world opened before my eyes. During this part of my journey, I took the following courses on a YouTube channel called "Píldoras Informáticas":

* [Curso Access 2010 Básico](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDA8B66B264169835)
* [Curso Access 2010 Avanzado](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL87EB5DB749276DAF)
* [Curso VBA Access](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3E8FA619DF71898)

I took these courses at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021.

Armed with this new knowledge, I started working on that first project. It was a struggle there was no AI to help back then, so I spent hours googleing things and asking questions on forums. But after a lot of hard work, I managed to finish the project and deliver it to my clients (clients even though I wasn’t paid, I approached it professionally).  

* **7/31/2021** – Deployment of the "Gestor de casas de posturas"

I was thrilled. I had created a full application entirely on my own! But I wanted to go further. Living in a farm town, I noticed many other agricultural businesses in need of software solutions. My next project involved planning the growth of seedlings under greenhouses. To tackle this, I wanted to upgrade my skills and learn Windows Forms development with C++. Yes, C++.  

Why C++? Well, I had an Arduino and some familiarity with the language, so I started watching YouTube tutorials and even read a full book on OOP in C++:  

* *Curso de C++ Programación Orientada a Objetos* by Salvador Pozo

Fortunately, I realized early enough that C++ wasn’t the ideal choice for this project but not before finishing the book. Then… C# came into my life. This was the language for me. I said to myself, *“let’s get to work!”* My next course was, as well, from "Píldoras Informáticas":

One of my biggest gaps in my first project was working with SQL. I could create visual queries in Access, but I didn’t understand the language itself. So naturally, the next step was learning SQL:

It’s worth noting that all of this learning, experimenting, and building projects was done as a side pursuit. I had a full-time job as an engineer, so my time was limited, but my passion kept me going.  

## The Next Project  

On August 25th, 2023, I started my new project and challenge: **“Green House Schedule.”**  

I spent about two weeks planning how to approach it, gathering requirements from my clients, roughly designing the UI, and defining the data. The logic part took longer. I struggled with impostor syndrome and told myself: *“Let’s first design how to approach the main algorithm of the program, because if I can't manage to create this, there is no point in creating all the structure around it.”* If the core don't work the rest is useless.  

That was the true purpose of this project, determining **when to grow client orders while considering the business’s limited resources** (such as area, seedling trays, manual labor, and time). I thought: *If I can’t figure this out, why even continue with the project?*  

But I persevered. I came up with a feasible approach and started building.  

A few months later, I run into Git and realized I needed to properly learn Git and source control, knowledge I hadn’t yet mastered. So, I paused development and studied Git; again with Juan Díaz on his YouTube channel [Píldoras Informáticas](https://www.youtube.com/@pildorasinformaticas). It took me almost a month to get to the level I wanted, but with hard work, I achieved it.  

* **8/23/2023** – Finished the [“Curso Git & GitHub” from Píldoras Informáticas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU8oAlHdN5BlyaPFiNQcV0xDqy0eR35aU)  

Now, with Git under my “black belt”, I could properly version my progress and continue working on the project.  

## Next Discovery: *Tim Corey*  

While wandering around YouTube looking for information on how to structure my app properly, I found the channel [IAmTimCorey](https://www.youtube.com/IAmTimCorey/playlists). Tim is a software developer with more than 20 years of industry experience and is a multiple-time Microsoft MVP. His videos are long, usually over 40 minutes and in them he tries not just to teach *how* things are done but also *why*, as well as the drawbacks and benefits of the choices you make during the development process and how they might affect the future of the product you're building.  

Among the many videos he has, I found this series: [C# Application From Start to Finish: Tournament Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLWMQd6PeGY3t63w-8MMIjIyYS7MsFcCi). In it, Tim teaches how to build a complete app while following best practices and making good decisions along the way. So, I decided to take it.  

I continued working on the **“Green House Schedule”** app, but I spent most of my time on the *Tournament Tracker* series. Then I realized I didn’t have enough time to keep making consistent progress, so…  

## Shift to Full-Time  

On **12/15/2023**, I decided to leave my job to focus all my time on this goal of mine: entering the IT industry as a software developer. Some of my family disliked this decision and wanted me to stay in the family business, but I refused. I had decided it was time to pursue my passion and live my own life.  

Now, with all my time available, I could finally make steady progress in both learning and development. I split my time equally between the **“Tournament Tracker”** and the **“Green House Schedule”**.  

One of the major things I learned in the series and applied to my app was error handling. I knew the basics of using a try-catch block, but where should I place it,in a deep layer or in the UI? Tim cleared up those doubts in his lessons. Another key insight was understanding what to do when an app is in production and breaks: how would I know the details of what caused the issue? To solve this, I added a logging system to track bugs.  

On **7/4/2024**, I finished the *Tournament Tracker* series, and a few days later, on **7/8/2024**, I completed the **“Green House Schedule”** and delivered the product to my clients.  

## Formal Education Ahead of Me  

I don't remember exactly how, but in the platform (edX)[https://www.edx.org/school/harvardx] I came across with [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) , the introductory course to computer science of the Harvard University. This is a 12 weeks course, with a lecture, some practice labs, and some excercises every week, but at your own pace. On the **7/9/2024** I started this new goal. The english of profesor David Malan, Dough Lloyd and Brian Yu was really fast. Thanks to years of lessons and practice, my english skills were up to the task. The first 6 week were easy I had experience in all the topics covered. The real challenge resided outside of my confort zone, in week 6 we covered Python, a programming language I'd never came across, so I had to spent some time learning the basics. Later in week 8 HTML, CSS and JavaScript". I had to spend a whole month to master these technologies at a confortable level in order to make the exercices of that week. Week 9 web application with Flask. And the excercises weren't easy. But I continued.

And finally there it was, The final project. I was undecided about what to build, I had known It would be a web application with flask, but there were so many things I could build with that. CS50 helped me improve my english through the fast spoken lesson, so I decided to make my project related to the learning of the english language. A web app course, it's what I was going to build, an app about the book [La Guia de los Tiempos Verbales](https://www.amazon.com/Guía-los-Tiempos-Verbales-Aprende-ebook/dp/B0777RFS2D) of Daniel Welsch. I contacted the author, told him my idea and asked for permition, the answer was positive and I started building. 

I was really happy with the result, I created a good app, you can find a video demo here: [Final project video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2pJ7SCmXtAA). I allowed permission to the CS50 staff to put my project in a repository with a bunch of other projects, to give inspiration to new students that need to face the same challenge.

Well after finishing CS50 my next step was going to take a list of courses in the platform [IAmTimCorey.com](https://www.iamtimcorey.com/). Between them some really important like: C# Mastercourse, Git From Start to Finish, Web Api From Start to Finish. But I wasn't ready. I needed some items that my sister was going to buy for me. By that time in Cuba, my country, we were facing long blackouts, so in order to make progress in my studies I needed a laptop with good battery life and a way to power up my internet router. For the laptop I had a MacBook so by that side I was covered. And for the router part I asked my sister for a 40k mAh power bank and an adapter cable from 5v to 9v, which was the voltage my router needed.

I've never had passed a paid course over the internet so I wanted to see what Tim's platform had to offer, so my sister bought me a Monthly Dev Pass, just to test the platform for a few days, make the complete list of the courses I wanted to take, and confirm that this was the right step (and it was). Three days later I canceled my subscription, and I started waiting for the items.

But in the meantime, I couldn't be inactive. I choose to buy 2 courses from Udemy: [Master Multithreading & Asynchronous Programming in C#/.NET](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-to-aspnet-core-identity) and [Master ASP.NET Core Identity: Authentication & Authorization](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-multithreading-asynchronous-programming-in-csharp-dotnet), both by Frank Liu. I started the first one and completed almost 75% of it, and then my package arrived. I tested it, they worked just fine. Well finally it was time to deep dive into Tim's content.

I started on **April 16th of 2025** with the C# Mastercourse,

This is not the end. This real story (my journey) is still under construction. Be patient, please.  

Continue from the point when I decided to seek a more formal education
